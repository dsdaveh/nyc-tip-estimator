Write a new Quarto doc to preprocess the data

Let's start by reading all the parquet files into a duckdb database,
report out the first/last trip dates, total data size (record count and  total memory memory).
---
use dbplyr and dbplyr for all data interrogation
---
make sure this only creates duckdb once, and just uses it if it already exists.
---
store the file in the data directory instead
---
use here::here() with all file locations
---
store the file in the data directory instead
---
change the code to use the native pipe rather than the tidyverse pipe
